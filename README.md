# Matplotlib_Challenge


## Background

In this mock study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. 

## Observations and Conclusions

* The Average Tumor Vol vs Mouse Weight in the Capomulin regimen has a direct correlation with a correlation coeficcient of 0.84, making this a drug regimen worth investigating further.

* Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest range of final tumor volume after completing observations on the mouse. Based on the box and wisker plot of the data, further investigation of these drugs is warranted. Additionally, Capomulin reduced the average tumor size for all mice over a testing period.

* Based on the above observations, Capomulin is the most promising regimen in this study, and should be further investigated.
